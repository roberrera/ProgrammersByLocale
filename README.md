# Programmers By Locale

This app parses a local JSON file to display a list of programmers who work at the selected location. 
Using a RecyclerView, the programmer's icon changes based on which platform they are associated with. 
Tapping on a programmer shows more details about them. 
Works in portrait and landscape, on phones and tablets.
